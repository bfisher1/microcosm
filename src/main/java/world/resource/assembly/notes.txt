Robot physical system will be made of
    movement system
        - wheels
        - axis
        - tires
        - motors
        assembly process:
            glue tires to wheels
            weld wheel to each end of axis
            weld motors to steer horizontal axis
            weld vertical axis to steer horizontal axis
            create gear system
                - needs gears, smaller pegs, board
            attach gears to motor, attatch to vertical axis
            then attach to chasis at end
    chasis
        - welded / screwed metal panes together
        - contains batteries
        - motherboard
    arms
        - sticks
        - joints
        - motors
        - rubber gripper
    head
        - head box
        - camera
        - neck
            - motors

arm animation:
    1 contracted at arm block -> reaching on neighbor block
        grab object on neighbor block -> retract to arm block with item
        rotate arm
        extend arm again to other neighbor
        place item there
