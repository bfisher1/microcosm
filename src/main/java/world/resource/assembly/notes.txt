Robot physical system will be made of
    movement system
        - wheels
        - axis
        - tires
        - motors
        assembly process:


            weld(disc, tire) => wheel
            weld(wheel, largeGear) => gearedWheel

            weld(motor, smallGear) => gearedMotor

            weld(2 gearedMotor, 2 gearedWheel, siding) => chassis

            weld(chassis, motor) => rotatableChassis



    body
        - weld(7 panel) => frame
        - weld(batteries, motherboard, frame) => electronicFilledFrame
    arms
        - sticks
        - joints
        - motors
        - rubber gripper
    head
        - head box
        - camera
        - neck
            - motors

// todo remove, i don't like different sizes of gears, maybe just small. too complicated

// how about right now, simple items
// then later, make more complex recipes

simplified assembly of core modules:
        weld10Times(2 disc, 2 tire, 2 largeGear, 3 motor, 2 smallGear, 1 panel) => 1 chassis

        weld10Times(6 panel, 2 battery, 1 motherboard) => 1 frame

        weld20Times(2 stick, 3 joint, 3 motor, 2 small stick, 2 rubberGripper) => 1 arm

        weld10Times(6 smallPanel, 1 camera, 2 motors) => 1 head

        weldLong(drill, motor) => 1 drillTool

bot assembly:
        weldLong(2 chassis, 1 frame, 1 drillTool)
        screw(2 arm, frame)
        screw(camera, frame)
